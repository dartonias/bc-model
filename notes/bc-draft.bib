  abstract={The authors study the interface behaviour of the two-dimensional Blume-Emery-Griffiths model (1971) which is described by the Hamiltonian H=-J Sigma (ij) S i S j =K Sigma (ij) S i 2 S j 2 +D Sigma i S i 2 S i =1, 0, -1. An interface is introduced into the system by fixing the spins on opposite boundaries in two different states, +1 and -1. They pay particular attention to the appearance of an excess of the third state, 0, in the vicinity of the interface. The net adsorption of the non-boundary state is studied near critical, first-order and tricritical transitions. Two methods have been used to attack this problem, the Monte Carlo technique and a modified version of the interface free energy approximation of Muller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1977) which is seen to give a surprisingly good description of interface properties in three-state systems.}

  abstract={The magnetic properties of a spin-1 Blume–Capel (BC) model on a square lattice ( q =4) with a ferromagnetic interaction have been examined here by the use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique and an introduced effective-field approximation (IEFT), which includes the correlations between different spins that emerge when expanding the identities. The effects of the external magnetic field and crystal field on the magnetic properties of the spin system are discussed in detail. In order to obtain credible results, a detailed comparison of the results obtained by the two methods has been made with those of the other methods in the literature. A number of interesting phenomena originating from the temperature, crystal field and external field have been found.}
